## ðŸ“Œ Installation

```bash
pip install hermessmiles
```

---

## Usage
```bash
from hermessmiles.processor import SMILESProcessor, find_overlaps
from hermessmiles.visualizer import Visualizer
proc = SMILESProcessor()
df1 = proc.process("assets/df1.csv")
df2 = proc.process("assets/df2.csv")
overlaps = find_overlaps(df1, df2)
viz = Visualizer(overlaps, "output/results.html")
viz.render()
```

By default, the output HTML is saved as `overlap_structures_<timestamp>.html` in your working directory.
